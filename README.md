### Usage

This document actually serves as a personal reminder of vim configuration for myself. Please check [Use vim as IDE](https://github.com/yangyangwithgnu/use_vim_as_ide) about all the functions for convenient C++ coding. If you cannot read Chinese but are eager to learn about it, please consult your Chinese colleagues or pick up some Chinese first :)
